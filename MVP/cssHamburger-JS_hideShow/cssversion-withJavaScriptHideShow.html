        <p>In Hertford, Hereford and Hampshire, hurricanes hardly
          ever happen.</p>

      <section id="courtesyContent">
        <h3>Courtesy</h3>
        <p>When a person's personality is personable he shouldn't
          oughta sit like a lump. It's harder than a matador coercin'
          a bull to try to get you off of your rump.</p>

        <h3>Optional Relief and Optional Re-Throw</h3>
        <p>For something romantic De Sade is to trenchant and
          Dickens too frantic. And Stendhal would ruin rhe plan
          of attack, As there isn't much blue in "The Red and
          the Black."</p>

      <section id="excessiveContent">
        <h3>Excessive Time</h3>
        <p>De Maupassant's candour would cause her dismay.
          The Brontes are grander, but not very gay. Her taste
          is much blander I'm sorry to say. But is Hans Christian
          Andersen ever risque?</p>

        <p>She wouldn't... therefore they didn't... So then it

        <h3>Mandatories</h3>
        <p>Greens Green and Nothing but green! Parsley, Peppers,
          Cabbages, and Celery. Asparagus and Watercress and
          Fiddlefern and Lettuce. He said "Alright!" But it
          wasn't quite, cause I caught him in the autumn in my
          garden one night!</p>

          I'm telling you the same I tell Kings and Queens don't ever
          ever ever mess around with my greens! Especially the beans!</p>

      <section id="applicationContent">
        <h3>Application of the Rules</h3>
        <p>What you do, that's the point: All the rest of it is
          chatter. If the thing you do is pure in intent, if it's
          meant, and it's just a little bent, does it matter?</p>
