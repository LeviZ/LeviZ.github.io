            A. What is a provisional throw?
          </label></h2>
          <article class="ac-small">
            <p>Provisional throws are extra throws that are not added to a player's score if they are not ultimately used in the completion of the hole. The use of provisional throws is encouraged in all situations where there is a question regarding a player's lie and a provisional throw would expedite play, or when the thrower questions a ruling. The unused throws are not to be added to the thrower's score nor treated as practice throws as long as the player announces that such additional throws are provisional throws prior to making them.</p>

            B. When is a provisional throw appropriate?
          </label></h2>
          <article class="ac-small">
            <p>Provisional throws are appropriate in the following circumstances:</p>
            <ol class="sub-detail">
              <li>To save time. A player may declare a provisional throw any time:
                <ul class="sub-detail">
                  <li>The status of a disc cannot readily be determined; and,</li>
                  <li>The majority of the group agrees that playing a provisional throw may save time; and,</li>
                  <li>The original throw may be out-of-bounds, may be lost, or may have missed a mandatory.</li>
                </ul>
              The thrower shall complete the hole from whichever of the two throws is deemed by the group or an official to have resulted in the correct lie.</li>
              <li>To appeal the group's or an official's ruling. A set of provisional throws may be taken to complete a hole as part of an appeal when the player disagrees with the group decision and an official is not readily available, or if the player wishes to appeal the decision of an official. The scores from both sets of throws shall be recorded. The proper ruling and score are then determined by the Director at the end of the round.</li>

            <p>A provisional throw may not be subsequently declared to be an optional re-throw.</p>
