          </label></h2>
          <article class="ac-small">
            <p>A mandatory restricts the path the disc may take to the target. A disc must pass the correct side of the mandatory before the hole is completed. A disc has passed the mandatory once it establishes a position beyond the mandatory line.</p>
            <ol class="sub-detail">
              <li>The mandatory line is the line marked by the director or course designer to indicate when a disc has passed or missed the mandatory.</li>
              <li>If no line has been marked, the mandatory line is defined as a straight line through the mandatory, perpendicular to the line connecting the mandatory to the previous mandatory, or if there is no previous mandatory, the tee.</li>
              <li>In the case of a double mandatory when no line has been marked, the mandatory line is the straight line connecting the two mandatories, and extends beyond them in both directions.</li>
