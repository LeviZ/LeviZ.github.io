    <article class="ac-small">
      <p>These rules have been designed to promote fair
        play for all disc golfers. In using these rules,
        players shall apply the rule that most directly
        addresses the situation at hand. If any point in
        dispute is not covered by the rules, the decision
        shall be made in accordance with fairness. Often
        a logical extension of the closest existing rule
        or the principles embodied in these rules will
        provide guidance for determining fairness.</p>
