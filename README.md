#Disc Golf Rule Book
A Project for Code Fellows B25
By Sheyna Watkins, Levi Zortman and Loann Lam

###Background
Levi plays disc golf. He and his friends are quite devoted to the game. But they have trouble when they are out on a course playing the game they don't have easy access to the rules. When a play is called into conflict it is difficult to find the relevant rule in current similar applications. From our user research we found that players often carry the full rule book onto the field or have a pdf formatted version of the rule book on their phone.

###Objective/Goal:
We created an app that would allow disc golfers to more easily access the rules to make calls while on the course playing. We sought to learn the areas that cause the most confusion among players. We believe we can found a better way to provide it and that by providing players with better information it increases their enjoyment of the game.

###Project Notes:
We used a CSS hamburger menu to leverage the power of the GPU. The content is displayed using a CSS accordion.

We managed the file structure in two ways. The first uses a hide/show method to keep the app on one HTML document. This way disc golf players can access the app easily while they are out on the course where they probably don't have many bars on their phones. This option may be seen on this project's master branch.

The second file structure option, breaks up the site into smaller pages that are flowed into the main page via Ajax. This option may be seen on this project's "ajax" branch.
